## Example

- Instruction: Write a poem about a llama.
- Input: Llamas are cute.
- Response:
    > Llamas are cute,  
    > With their long necks sloping to the ground,  
    > Their tails flicking back and forth,  
    > As they stand upon the hills so proud.  
    >
    > They come in many colors,  
    > From the bright yellow to the darker shades of brown,  
    > Each one unique in its own way,  
    > With their spiky horns and their long, flowing manes.  
    >
    > Though they may not be the most graceful of creatures,  
    > They sure are a lot of fun,  
    > And who knows what they do when no one's around
